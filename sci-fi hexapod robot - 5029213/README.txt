Summary:
Hello,eveyone.This is the hexapod robot I modeled and built resently.It can walk and fire soft bullet.Now i decide to open source the model.The model is finished with solidworks 2020 and  you can edit it yourself.The servo i used is LX-224.Im not sure whether you can buy it out of China,so if you guys want to use other kinds of servos,don't forget to edit the model to make it suitable for your servo.Hope you have funhttps://youtu.be/WT9nSq0wHZA
